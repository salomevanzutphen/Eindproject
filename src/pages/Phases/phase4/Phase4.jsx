                    <p>The luteal phase is a great time for organizing yourself and planning ahead. Wrap up any pending
                        tasks on your to-do list, declutter your space and ease up on the intensity of your workouts.
                        Soon you will be needing a lot more rest, as the menstrual phase is approaching. You may already
                        start to feel a dip in energy towards the end of this phase, making you more sensitive to stress
                        and anxiety. Therefore it is wise to use your time effectively now, so that you have more time
                        to rest later.

                <h2>How progesterone shapes your luteal phase experience</h2>
                <p>As estrogen levels drop, progesterone begins to rise, playing a crucial role in your body's hormonal balance. Progesterone helps soothe your mood by stimulating GABA receptors in your brain, making you feel more calm and collected. Its mild sedative properties also promote better sleep. Additionally, progesterone acts as a natural diuretic, helping to release excess fluid from your body. Therefore, if you experience increased anxiety, mood swings, insomnia, and excessive bloating during the this phase, it could indicate that your progesterone levels are too low.

                <p>PMS is a range of physical, emotional and behavioural symptoms that women experience during the luteal phase. Although the direct cause is unknown, low progesterone, stress, lack of sleep, hormonal imbalances and a deficient diet can exacerbate the symptoms. Find out below what nutrients can aid you most during this time.  </p>

                                Your body increases progesterone to get the uterine lining ready for a potential pregnancy. If pregnancy doesnâ€™t occur, hormones start to drop and your cycle will be restarted with your period.
                                Additionally, serotonin levels can drop during this phase, which may cause you to crave carbohydrates, as these foods help boost serotonin production.
