This sometimes includes difficult transitions, where we have to let go of comfortability and step into the unknown. Sacrifices will have to be made, but it will be for your highest good. Persephone was abducted into the dark underworld, which turned her from a young naive girl into a powerful queen that helps others transition from life to death. Embrace the transitions in your life and give yourself time to adapt. If something isn’t working out as you hoped, learn to detach, because it simply wasn’t meant to be.
