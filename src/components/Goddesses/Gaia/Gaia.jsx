Gaia wants you to heal your body using mother earthâ€™s blessings; try herbal remedies, eat more fresh unprocessed foods and spend more time outside. This is your sign to connect to mother nature and reduce artificial toxins in your environment that could harm your health. She represents the physical body, fertility and the power of feminine creativity, the cycles of nature and origin of life. </p></div>
